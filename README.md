# Random Raffle Contract

## About

This code is to create a proveably random smart contract lottery

## What I plane to do here?

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket 
    1. The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner

3. Using Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Automation
    1. Chainlink VRF -> Randomness 
    2. Chainlink Automation -> Time based trigger
